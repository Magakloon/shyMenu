Duty based ESX admin system.

This is a duty & ace permission based system that allows the use of admin commands only when the designated admin is on duty. Utilizes okokNotify (notify function coming soon) but you can replace the export with your own.

The script is written for a dutch server, and thus is translated in dutch. Translation to english coming soon.
